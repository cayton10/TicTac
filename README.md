# TicTac
jQuery Tic Tac Toe(ish) Project

# jQuery 
This was my first real project developing with jQuery. I'm enjoying the free flowing functionality with this lib over vanilla jS. The control
flow for checking win conditions is kind of out of hand. I would have preferred a more efficient and maintainable way to determine a 
winner. I attempted to accomplish this with array comparison, but I couldn't quite get it worked out by the deadline. 

# Bootstrap
As far as themes go, this thing is pretty loud, but I'm ok with it. I built it from the ground up just using bootstrap framework
and an AOS js plugin for some animations. I'm pretty happy with the theming. I started putting a lot of work into the media queries, but
similar to the array comparison deal, I started running out of time.
